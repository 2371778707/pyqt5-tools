|AppVeyor|_

The PyQt5 wheels do not provide tools such as Qt Designer that were included in
the old binary installers. This package aims to provide those in a separate
package which is useful for developers while the official PyQt5 wheels stay
focused on fulfilling the dependencies of PyQt5 applications.
